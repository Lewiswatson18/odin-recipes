    <h2>How to Make Chicken Parmesan That's Never Soggy</h2>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while
        this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
    <p>In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I
        have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much
        sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that
        way, not with this method.</p>
    <p>Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to
        great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on
        top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine,
        you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously,
        most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh
        mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.</p>
    <p>Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of
        flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring
        them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down.</p>

    <h2>Chef John's Top Tips for Making Chicken Parmesan</h2>
    <p>Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Pound chicken to an even thickness</li>
        <p>Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the
            thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</p>
        <li>Don't skimp on seasoning</li>
        <p>Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</p>
        <li>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs</li>
        <p>Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken,
            the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</p>
        <li>Rest before cooking</li>
        <p>Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere
            to the chicken breast.</p>
        <li>Go easy on the sauce</li>
        <p>THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good
            thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and
            cheese?</p>
        <li> Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot</li>
        <p>Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading
            to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.</p>
    </ol>
