    <h1>Hamburger</h1>
    <p>A simple way to spruce up your burgers. Cook out on the grill, or just fry in a pan indoors. Serve on buns with
        lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard and onions.</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon steak sauce (e.g. A-1), or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, and garlic. Mix in steak sauce until mixture is sticky
            feeling. Form into 3 or 4 balls, and flatten into patties.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Grill for about 10 minutes, turning once, or to your desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature
            should be at 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer. Serve on buns with the usual
            trimmings.</p>

    </ol>
